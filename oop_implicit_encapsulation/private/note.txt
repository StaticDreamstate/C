You cannot use malloc directly in the preceding example. That's because if 
you are going to use malloc inside the main function, you have to pass
sizeof(list_t) as the required number of bytes that should be allocated.
However, you cannot use sizeof for an incomplete type.

The list_t type included from the header file is an incomplete type because it is
just a declaration that doesn't give any information regarding its internal fields,
and we don't know its size while compiling it. The real size will be determined
only at link time when we know the implementation details. As a solution, we
had to have the list_malloc function defined and have malloc used in a place
where sizeof(list_t) is determined.
